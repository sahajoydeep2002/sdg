Question 1 [5 points] Imagine you are a junior system administrator responsible for managing a Linux server. Your supervisor has given you various tasks related to common Linux commands. Your goal is to demonstrate your knowledge and proficiency in using these commands to maintain and troubleshoot the server eﬀectively.

Answer ==

a)	Change your user account's password to "SecurePwd123."
Bash –

passwd

Enter your current password and then type in your new password twice.

b)	List all users currently logged into the server.
Bash –

who

This will display a list of all users currently logged into the server, along with their login time and terminal number.

c)	Determine your own username and user ID (UID) on the server.
Bash –

whoami id

The whoami command will display your username, while the id command will display your username, UID, and other information about your user account.

d)	Create a text file named "important_notes.txt" and write the message "Confidential: For authorized personnel only" into the file.

Bash-
 
touch important_notes.txt
echo "Confidential: For authorized personnel only" > important_notes.txt

The touch command creates an empty file, and the echo command writes the specified message to the file.

e)	Access the manual page for the "ls" command to learn more about its options and usage.

Bash-
man ls

// Tried Installing man incase not found by this code -sudo apt-get install man

This will open the man page for the ls command, which provides detailed information about the command's options and usage.

f)	List the contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories, in long format.

Bash -
ls -la

The -l option tells ls to display files in long format, which includes information about the file's permissions, owner, group, size, and modification time. The -a option tells ls to display all files, including hidden files and directories.

g)	Replace all occurrences of the letter 'a' with 'A' in a text file named "text.txt."

Bash –

sed -i 's/a/A/g' text.txt

The sed command is a stream editor that can be used to search for and replace text in files. The -i option tells sed to modify the file in place, rather than printing the modified text to the screen. The s/a/A/g command tells sed to replace all occurrences of the letter 'a' with the letter 'A' in the file.

h)	Display the hostname of your server.
 
Bash -
hostname

This will display the hostname of your server.

i)	Trace the network route from your local machine to the 'www.example.com' server ( I used google for simple use)

Bash –

traceroute www.google.com

The traceroute command traces the network route from your local machine to the specified host. It displays a list of hops along the route, along with the time it takes to reach each hop.

j)	Perform a basic port scan of a target server with the IP address "10.0.0.1."

Bash -
nmap 10.0.0.1

The nmap command is a port scanner that can be used to scan a target server for open ports. The nmap 10.0.0.1 command will scan all TCP ports on the server with the IP address "10.0.0.1" and display a list of open ports and their associated services.


  


 

 



 
 





















 
Question 2 –

You are working as a junior system administrator in a company that uses Linux servers for various tasks. Your supervisor has assigned you a series of tasks related to file permissions, file and directory operations, copying, and moving files and directories using Linux commands. Your goal is to successfully complete these tasks to ensure the proper management of the company's data and files.

Answer ==

1.	Create a "reports" directory in your home folder with permissions set so that only the owner has read, write, and execute privileges while others have no access.
- To navigate to the home directory and create the directory: 

Bash –


mkdir reports chmod 700 reports

2.	Inside the "reports" directory, generate a file named "monthly_report.txt" allowing the owner to read and write, the group to read, and others to have no access.
- Creating the file and setting permissions:
Bash --
cd reports
touch monthly_report.txt chmod 640 monthly_report.txt

3.	Copy the "monthly_report.txt" file to another directory while preserving its original permissions.
- Copying the file to a new location:

Bash --
cp -p ~/reports/monthly_report.txt ~/reports_temp

4.	Move the "monthly_report.txt" file from a diﬀerent directory to the "reports" directory ensuring it retains its initial permissions.
- Moving the file while retaining permissions:

Bash --
mv ~/reports_temp/monthly_report.txt ~/reports

5.	List all files and directories within the "reports" directory, including hidden ones.**
- Displaying contents of the directory:

Bash --
ls -la ~/reports

6.	Rename the "reports" directory to "quarterly_reports" without altering its location or content.
- Renaming the directory:

Bash --
mv ~/reports ~/quarterly_reports

7.	Create a "backups" directory in your home directory and make "daily" and "weekly" subdirectories inside it.
 
- Creating the directory structure:

Bash –

mkdir ~/backups mkdir ~/backups/daily
mkdir ~/backups/weekly

8.	Generate an empty file named "important.txt" in the "daily" subdirectory within the "backups" directory.
- Creating an empty file:

Bash –

touch ~/backups/daily/important.txt

9.	Move the "important.txt" file from the "daily" subdirectory to the "weekly" subdirectory while ensuring the file keeps its original name.

- Moving the file while retaining its name:

Bash --
mv ~/backups/daily/important.txt ~/backups/weekly

10.	Display the absolute path of your present working directory.
- Showing the absolute path:

Bash --
pwd
 

 




 

Question 3 - You have been hired as a junior system administrator for a company that manages a Linux server hosting critical data and applications. Your supervisor has assigned you a series of tasks related to understanding and managing links, inodes, and superblocks using Linux commands. Your goal is to successfully complete these tasks to ensure the proper maintenance of the server.

Answer –

1.	Create a hard link from the "important_data.txt" file in the root directory to your home directory and confirm the linkage by checking the inode.
- Command:
Bash--
ln ~/important_data.txt ~/hl_data.txt ls -i ~/important_data.txt ~/hl_data.txt

2.	In your home directory, generate a symbolic link to the "important_data.txt" file located in the root directory. Verify permissions and the symbolic link's inode number.
- Command:
Bash --
ln -s ~/important_data.txt ~/sl_data.txt ls -li ~/sl_data.txt

3.	Display all hard links to the "important_data.txt" file, including their full paths.**
- Command:
Bash --
ﬁnd / -sameﬁle /important_data.txt 2>/dev/null

4.	Retrieve detailed information about the "important_data.txt" file, such as its size, owner, group, and permissions.
- Command:
Bash --
ls -l ~/important_data.txt

5.	Display the disk space usage of the filesystem where the "important_data.txt" file is located, showing available space, used space, and filesystem size.

- Command: (This would depend on the filesystem and its corresponding command, e.g.,
`df -h /path/to/filesystem`)

6.	Extract and present details about the superblock of the filesystem where "important_data.txt" resides, including block size and filesystem features.
 
- Command:
Bash -
dumpe2fs /dev/sda2

7.	Create a "backup" subdirectory in your home directory, move "important_data.txt" into it from the root directory, and check the file's inode post-relocation.
- Command:
Bash --
mkdir ~/backup
mv ~/important_data.txt ~/backup/ ls -i ~/backup/important_data.txt

8.	Generate a new symbolic link in your home directory pointing to the relocated "important_data.txt" file within the "backup" directory. Confirm the validity of the link.
- Command:
bash --
ln -s ~/backup/important_data.txt ~/sl_backup_data.txt ls -li ~/sl_backup_data.txt

9.	Explain why hard links cannot span across diﬀerent filesystems, referencing inodes and superblocks.
- Explanation:
Hard links rely on the inode structure within a single filesystem. Each inode uniquely identifies a file within that filesystem. As diﬀerent filesystems have their independent inode structures and superblocks, a hard link cannot cross filesystems since the inode numbers aren’t synchronized between them.

10.	Outline a backup strategy for "important_data.txt" ensuring link integrity and efficient disk usage.
- Strategy: Utilize a backup tool compatible with hard and symbolic links, like rsync with the `-H` option. For instance:

Bash --
rsync -a -H ~/backup/important_data.txt ~/

This command preserves hard links and properly handles symbolic links, ensuring link integrity and efficient disk usage during backup.

-	Command:
Bash -
mkpart primary ext4 1MB 1855MB

-	Explanation: The command establishes an ext4 filesystem, initializing a partition starting at 1MB and ending at 1855MB.

9.	Perform data recovery from a damaged sector on a partition, outlining steps involved in the data recovery process.

- My Response: If a sector is damaged, data recovery can be challenging. Typically, utilizing backup copies of the data, if available, is the first step. Tools like ddrescue or specialized recovery software might be used. It's crucial to work on a copy of the damaged partition to avoid further data loss.

10.	Determine disk usage of a specific directory and its subdirectories, showcasing space consumed by each subdirectory.
